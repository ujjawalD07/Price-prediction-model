# Price-prediction-model
This is a car prediction model made using Linear regression algorithm and python language.
A dataset is downloaded from kaggle and important exploratory data analysis is applied on the dataset to get a clean and algorithm friendly version of it.
Finally the model is trained and linear regression is appplied. The model is later dumped as a pickle file.
